# Sparkbot

sparkbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Running sparkbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start sparkbot locally by running:

    % npm start

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    sparkbot>

Then you can interact with sparkbot by typing `sparkbot help`.

    sparkbot> sparkbot help
    sparkbot help - Displays all of the help commands that sparkbot knows about.
    ...
